# Giphy-API
Giphy API

I created an Comic Book Superhero App full of gifs using the giphy api!!!
Here is the documentation for the Giphy API: https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI
I made an array of superheros and made buttons out of them.
When you click on a button, 10 images are retrieved from giphy and displayed on the page.
When you click on the image, the gif plays. When you click again, the gif stops playing.
Yu can add a new superherp from the form on the right side of the page. The superhero will be added to the array of superhero and added as a new button
The rating of each gif will also appear on the page.
Don't worry, If you put a villian, it still works!
